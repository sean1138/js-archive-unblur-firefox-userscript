# archive.org unblur images in shadow dom
Firefox Greasemonkey userscript for removing the preview blur in titles marked inappropriate on archive.org

# Credits
ChatGPT adapted the content.js code from [RefomerAgent's Archive-Unblur](https://github.com/ReformerAgent/Archive-Unblur) Chrome extension to work with the mess of javascript i was working on to do the same thing.  My js was failing to persist the unblurring (from infinite scrolling pages) before showing chatjibidy the content.js code from ReformerAgent.
